## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Icons

### What I learned

This was my first brush with using external libraries to add components to my pages. I used [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) to add the social icons in the footer section and the biggest takeaway from implement this was getting used to read the documentations for this library, which is an essential when working with different frameworks.
